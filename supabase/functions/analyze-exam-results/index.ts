Analyze this student's performance on a multiple-choice exam where they scored ${score}% (${correctCount} correct out of ${totalQuestions} questions).

Each question includes the full text, answer choices, the student's selected answer, and the correct answer.

Based on this data, provide a detailed and personalized analysis with these sections:

1. Performance Summary (Around 200 words)
   - Summarize the student's performance with specific details about score, strong areas, and weak areas
   - Use a warm, encouraging, and personalized tone like a real tutor
   - Mention 1-2 specific concepts they clearly understand well
   - Point out patterns in their incorrect answers (if any)

2. Identified Knowledge Gaps (Around 200 words)
   - Name the precise topics or concepts they struggled with based on incorrect answers
   - For each weak area, explain exactly why it might be challenging for them
   - Link these weak areas to specific questions they missed
   - Use a constructive, not critical, tone

3. Concepts to Review (Around 200 words)
   - List 3-5 specific subtopics they should review based on their performance
   - Explain each concept briefly and why it's important to understand
   - For each concept, mention how it connects to other important topics

4. Recommended Study Strategy (Around 200 words)
   - Suggest 3-5 actionable, concrete study activities for their specific weak areas
   - Recommend specific learning techniques tailored to their performance patterns
   - Include estimated time commitments for each activity
   - Use a motivating, encouraging tone that emphasizes growth
   - End with a positive, personalized note of encouragement

Here is the exam result data:
${formattedExamData}

Important: Be specific, detailed, and personal in your analysis. Mention actual topics and concepts from the questions. Write as a supportive, knowledgeable tutor who is genuinely interested in helping the student improve.
